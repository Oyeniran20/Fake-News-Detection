Detecting Fake News using Machine learning

The proliferation of fake news across digital platforms has become a significant global challenge, influencing public opinion and undermining trust in credible information sources. This study addresses the pressing need for efficient detection mechanisms by leveraging machine learning techniques to classify news articles as fake or real. Using a publicly available dataset comprising 63,019 records with binary labels (1 for fake news and 0 for real news), the research evaluates the performance of multiple supervised machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure text uniformity, and class imbalance was mitigated using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Features were extracted using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), enabling effective representation of textual data for model training.

Comprehensive model evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Results indicated that Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance with a precision of 88% and an F1-score of 86%, underscoring its reliability in distinguishing fake news. Logistic Regression and Random Forest also demonstrated competitive performance, while Support Vector Machines and XGBoost offered nuanced insights into model behavior on textual data. To further interpret model outputs, confusion matrices and graphical plots of precision, recall, and F1-scores were employed, offering clarity on prediction efficacy.

This research highlights the importance of precision in fake news detection, minimizing the risk of misclassifying real news. Challenges such as computational limitations, dataset representativeness, and unseen linguistic patterns were identified and addressed through robust validation techniques. The findings pave the way for deploying automated detection systems in media platforms, enhancing their ability to mitigate the spread of misinformation. Future work may explore incorporating deep learning techniques, larger datasets, and real-time detection pipelines for improved scalability and contextual understanding. This study underscores the critical role of machine learning in combating the pervasive issue of fake news and reinforces its applicability in real-world scenarios.
